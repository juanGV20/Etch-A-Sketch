# Etch-A-Sketch
This project consists of an Etch-A-Sketch-type game developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to draw on an interactive grid by moving the cursor, simulating the operation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch. The goal is to practice DOM manipulation, events, and basic logic in the browser.
